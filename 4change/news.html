<h4 class="lighter">Legal Actions</h5>
	 <hr class="my-2">
	 <p class="lead"> The article I read “House Passes Policing Bill Targeting Racial Biased and Use of Force” written by the New York Times. The article presented information about the battle this Bill had in order for it to get passed. The Republican party and Democratic party had very opposing views on this Bill, as the Republicans did not agree with it at all and created a counter Bill to replace it. In the counter Bill referred to as the G.O.P Bill or Mr.Scott’s Bill, In this bill the republicans came up with a different way to deal with systemic racism. This bill would require police to be educated on the history of racism and oppression . But it was quickly debunked by the Democratic party as it is not as effective and powerful as holding racist police and law enforcement legally accountable. Although the presidential party threatened to even Veto the bill, the Democrats kept fighting. But as of Thursday June 25 2020, the House Legislation passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act of 2020. <br>
The reason why this Event holds such importance is because it can change the very system of law enforcement, causing  the very fall of racial bias within the legal system. The current movement called the Black Lives Matter movement is to dismantle the racially biased police system. Creating this Act helps the movement move forward and creates a change in the political system that generations have been fighting for since the late 1960’s when the Civil Rights Act was passed. Even though it was passed and has been in place for years racially charged politicians have found loopholes, Causing more Acts to be put into place to override them. The relevance of this to our class is the discussion of political changes that happened in the past and ones that are currently going on now, as most of these political acts can be the reason for the current ones in place now. <br>
In my personal opinion I'm glad the legislation created the Act and passed the Bill. I side with the Democrats because the Bill that the Republican party was trying to pass is, well metaphorically speaking a slap on the wrist. The republicans idea of instead educating the law enforcement on racism and oppression rather then holding them accountable for their unlawful racially biased decisions in the workforce, is like telling a child not to steal candy after they’ve done it multiple times and not rightfully discipline them. This Act will help to pave the way for a more equal and just society.
